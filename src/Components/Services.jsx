        What Makes Us Unique
      </h1>
      <p className='text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed px-2 sm:px-6 text-justify'>
        What sets our platform apart is the way we reimagine travel planning through personalization, local insight, and accessibility. Unlike traditional travel apps that offer one-size-fits-all suggestions, we focus on creating deeply customized itineraries that match your individual preferences, whether you're an adventure seeker, a culture lover, or a wellness enthusiast. We bring to light the hidden gems of Sri Lanka, from secluded beaches and family-run eateries to spiritual retreats and cultural festivals, all recommended by locals who know the land best.
        <br /><br />
        Our platform not only makes it easy to plan and organize your entire trip in one place, including booking hotels, transport, and unique activities but also empowers local guides and small businesses by giving them a space to shine and connect directly with travelers. With features like offline itinerary access, real-time weather and event alerts, safety tools, and multi-language support, we’re committed to making travel smoother, more inclusive, and more meaningful.
